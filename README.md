# Background:
My friends get mad because I am slow in finding the best combination for starting mexican dominos :(
To make them less sad I will write a set of algorithms that make me faster at the game

# Algorithmic Problem Statement
Given a set of Dominos (a domino has 2 sides with numbers on each side N,M). Your initial move should maximize the sum of dominos that you can chain such that 2 adjacent dominos have the same number. The head of the chain must correspond to a number that is equal to the number in the middle/number of round.

# Proposed Algorithmic Solution
*backtracking*
